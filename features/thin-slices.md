# Vertical Thin Slices

Implementation order for HomeVault. Each slice is independently deployable and demonstrable. Work top-to-bottom — dependencies are strict.

---

## Slice 0 — Deployable Skeleton

_No features, just a working deploy pipeline end-to-end._

- Initialise `apps/api`: Express + TypeScript + pino + health endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`)
- Initialise `apps/web`: Vite + React + Tailwind + placeholder homepage
- Set up Knex in `packages/db` with connection to local Docker Postgres
- Write first migration: `users` table only
- Deploy API to Railway (verify health check passes)
- Deploy frontend to Vercel (verify build succeeds)
- Connect Neon as the production database, run migration
- Set up GitHub Actions CI (lint + typecheck + test on push)

**Done when:** `GET /health/ready` returns 200 in production and the Vercel frontend loads.

---

## Slice 1 — Authentication

_Users can sign up, verify email, sign in, and sign out._

- Configure Clerk dashboard (email + password, dev + prod key pairs)
- Install `@clerk/clerk-react` in `apps/web`, wrap app in `ClerkProvider`
- Build Sign Up, Sign In, and Verify Email pages using Clerk components
- Add `requireAuth` middleware to `apps/api` using `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`
- Implement `POST /api/v1/users/sync` — create local `users` record from Clerk JWT
- Implement `GET /api/v1/users/me` — return current user profile
- Add auth token attachment to the API fetch wrapper in `apps/web`
- Protect all frontend routes; redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`

**Done when:** A new user can complete the full sign-up → verify → sign-in → sign-out loop in production.

---

## Slice 2 — Document Upload

_Users can upload a PDF, give it a name, and see it in their library._

> **Note:** Items and Spaces have been removed from the data model. Documents are the primary entity — owned directly by the user with no folder or grouping hierarchy. This slice replaces what was previously two separate slices (Items CRUD and Document Upload).

- Write migration: `documents` table
- Create `packages/storage`: R2 client wrapper, `generateUploadUrl`, `generateDownloadUrl`, `deleteObject`
- Configure Cloudflare R2 bucket (private, CORS for presigned PUT)
- Implement `POST /api/v1/documents/upload-url` — validate name + file, create DB record, return presigned URL
- Implement `POST /api/v1/documents/:id/confirm` — mark status `processing`
- Implement `GET /api/v1/documents` — flat list for current user, `?q=` name search
- Implement `GET /api/v1/documents/:id`, `PATCH /api/v1/documents/:id` (rename), `DELETE /api/v1/documents/:id`
- Implement `GET /api/v1/documents/:id/download-url` — presigned download URL
- Build documents dashboard: flat list with name, status badge, upload date
- Build upload flow: drag-and-drop zone + name input field; client-side validation before upload
- Wire status polling: `GET /api/v1/documents/:id` every 3s while `status === 'processing'`

**Done when:** A signed-in user can upload a PDF named "Samsung TV Manual", see it appear in their library with a `pending` badge, and download it back. Status remains `pending` until the ingestion pipeline (Slice 3) is wired up.

---

## Slice 3 — Document Ingestion Pipeline

_Uploaded PDFs are processed into searchable vector chunks._

- Set up Upstash Redis; configure BullMQ `ingestion` queue in `packages/db`
- Build `apps/worker`: BullMQ consumer process, connects to same Neon + Redis
- Write migration: `document_chunks` table with pgvector column + ivfflat index
- Wire `POST /api/v1/documents/:id/confirm` to enqueue a BullMQ job
- Implement ingestion job handler:
  - Download PDF from R2
  - Extract text with `pdf-parse`
  - Split with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (512 tokens, 50 overlap)
  - Batch embed chunks with OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
  - Bulk insert into `document_chunks`
  - Update document status → `ready` (or `failed` with error message)
- Deploy worker as second Railway service
- Frontend: status badge now transitions `pending → processing → ready`

**Done when:** Uploading a real appliance manual PDF results in `status: ready` and queryable chunks in the database.

---

## Slice 4 — RAG Chat (Core)

_Users can ask questions and get cited answers from their documents._

- Create `packages/ai`: LangChain RAG pipeline, prompt templates, citation parser
- Write migration: `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages` tables
- Integrate LangFuse — wrap every LLM call in a trace
- Implement `POST /api/v1/chat/sessions` — create session
- Implement `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id` — get session with messages
- Implement `POST /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id/messages` — the core RAG endpoint:
  - Embed user query
  - pgvector similarity search across **all of the user's document chunks** (no scoping by item or space — the entire library is always in scope)
  - Assemble grounded prompt with top-k context
  - Stream Claude response via SSE
  - Parse citations from response
  - Persist assistant message + citations
- Build chat UI in `apps/web`:
  - Text input + send button
  - Message list with streaming token-by-token display
  - Citation chips below each assistant message (document name + page)
  - "No relevant documents found" empty state

**Done when:** A user can type "How do I descale my coffee maker?" and receive a streamed, cited answer drawn from their uploaded manual.

---

## Slice 5 — Chat Session Management

_Users can start new conversations and revisit old ones._

- Implement `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions` — paginated session list
- Implement `DELETE /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id`
- Auto-generate session title from first user message (single LLM call, no streaming)
- Build session sidebar in `apps/web`: list of past sessions, new chat button
- Navigate between sessions without losing scroll position
- Wire citation chips to open the source PDF via presigned download URL

**Done when:** A user can see their full chat history, switch between sessions, and click a citation to download the source PDF.

---

## Slice 6 — Observability & Hardening

_The app is resilient and debuggable._

- Add Sentry to `apps/api` and `apps/web` — uncaught exceptions with user context
- Add `express-rate-limit`: 60 req/min general, 10 req/min on chat endpoint
- Add LangFuse prompt versioning — move system prompt out of code into LangFuse dashboard
- Add BullMQ Board as a protected Express route (`/admin/queues`)
- Add document re-processing: `POST /api/v1/documents/:id/reprocess` — re-enqueues failed jobs
- Harden health check: `/health/ready` verifies Neon, R2, and Redis connectivity
- Add `pino-http` request logging middleware — every request logged with duration + status

**Done when:** A failed ingestion can be retried from the UI, errors are visible in Sentry, and every chat trace is inspectable in LangFuse.

---

## Slice 7 — UI Polish & Responsiveness

_The app is demo-ready and works on mobile._

- Responsive layout: sidebar collapses to bottom nav on mobile
- Loading skeletons on all data-fetching states
- Error boundaries with user-friendly fallback UI
- Empty states with onboarding prompts (no documents, no chat history)
- Animate chat message appearance (fade-in per token)
- Favicon, page titles, and Open Graph meta tags

**Done when:** The app looks polished enough to record a demo video and share the URL in a portfolio or job application.

---

## Slice 8 — Advanced AI (Phase 2)

_Differentiating AI features that go beyond basic RAG._

- **Hybrid search**: combine pgvector cosine with PostgreSQL `ts_vector` full-text search (RRF re-ranking)
- **Query reformulation**: LLM rewrites ambiguous queries before retrieval
- **Structured extraction on ingestion**: extract document type, key dates, and metadata from the PDF automatically on upload
- **Conversational memory**: summarise sessions exceeding 10 turns, inject summary as context
- **Multi-document comparison**: "Compare the warranty terms across my appliance manuals"
- **LangFuse evals**: automated RAG quality scoring pipeline with curated test dataset
- **User feedback**: thumbs up/down on responses, scores written back to LangFuse traces

**Done when:** You can demo each capability individually and reference them in a technical interview as deliberate design decisions.
